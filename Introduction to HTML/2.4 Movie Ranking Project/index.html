    <h1>The Best Movies According to Winfrey</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Star Wars</h3>
    <p>I love the Star Wars series. I love the how they did the cinematography of this film given limited effects during the 70s.</p>
    <h3>Parasite</h3>
    <p>I really love the story of this movie. It shows the different lives of the rich and those who are living under.</p>
    <h3>The Notebook</h3>
    <p>I don't usually watch romance and drama movies, but this movie got me watching romance.</p>
